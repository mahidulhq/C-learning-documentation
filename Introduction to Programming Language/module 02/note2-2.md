## Modulus
modulus is use for to find remainder.
To find out the remainder of two numbers, we simply calculate a % b = remainder.  
for example we can write write a c program:  
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 12, remainder, b = 5;
    remainder = 12 % 5;
    printf("%d", remainder);
    return 0;
}
```
output: 
```c
2
```
