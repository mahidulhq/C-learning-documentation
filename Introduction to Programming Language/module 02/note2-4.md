## Logical operators
These types of operators used between two conditions and check whether True or False  
```&&``` Logical AND  
```||``` Logical OR  
```!``` Logical NOT  
EXAMPLE: 5 > 2 && 6 < 10  
There are two conditions and in the middle it there is an AND used. Now the answer will BE True. To understand this   
You need to understand the Truth-False table from Discrete Mathematics.

Logical NOT ```(!)``` work differently, it take place before one condition and make it flip like ! (5 > 2) the answer is False
