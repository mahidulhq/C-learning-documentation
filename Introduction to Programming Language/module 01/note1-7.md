```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
int num1 = 10;
return 0;
}
```
The 
variable took size in memory, like  
int --> 4 byte  
float --> 4  byte  
char --> 1 byte  

on computer,   
            8 bit = 1 byte  
            
            1021 byte = 1 kb  
            1 kb = 1 mb  
            1024 mb = 1 gb  
            1021 gb = 1 tb  
            ...  
computers don't understand anything other than 0 and 1 (binary), so  
0 = 1 bit  
1 = 1 bit  
0 = 1 bit  
1 = 1 bit
