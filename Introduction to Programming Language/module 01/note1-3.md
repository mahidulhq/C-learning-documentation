First c program 
```c
// Basic Structures
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {

printf("Hello World");

return 0;
}
```

Output: 
```c
Hello World
```

A header file like **#include<stdio.h>** in programming is like a neuron in our brain. Just as neurons transmit signals and instructions to tell the body how to react, header files provide essential declarations and commands that guide the program on how to function.
