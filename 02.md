## Arithmetic Operators
An operator is a symbol that performs a fixed operation between two numbers. like **+**.  
Arithmetic operator list:  
```
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulus
```
Example code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 5, sum, sub, mul, div;
    sum = a + b;
    sub = a - b;
    mul = a * b;
    div = a / b;

    printf("%d\n%d\n%d\n%d", sum, sub, mul, div);
 return 0;
}
```

Output:
```c
15
5
50
2
```
#### Tricks: select specific text or codes, then press ctrl + ```/``` to make it a comment. Or just put ```//``` before the one line text. you can add more than one line comment by using ```/* text here */```.

If I try to do :
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a = 7, b = 2, div;
    div = a / b;
    printf("%d\n", div);
 return 0;
}
```

Then the output will show: 
```c
3
```

But it's supposed to show 3.5. This happens because the ```a, b, div``` is an integer data type, which is why  
3.5 converts to the integer number 3.  
to print correctly:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    float a = 7, b = 2;
    float div;
    div = a / b; // Floating-point division
    printf("%f\n", div);
    return 0;
}
```
output:
```c
3.500000
```

## Mod operator -- modulus 
Modulus ```%``` is used to find the remainder. ```%``` This symbol is called the mod operator in the C language.
To find out the remainder of two numbers, we simply calculate a % b = remainder.  
For example, we can write a C program:  
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 12, remainder, b = 5;
    remainder = 12 % 5;
    printf("%d", remainder);
    return 0;
}
```
output: 
```c
2
```

##  Relational operators
```
< less than
<= less or equal than
> greater than
>= greater and equal than
== equals to
!= not equal to

```
This type of operator checks if the value is true or false, like  
if we put ```>``` between two number: 5 > 4 which is True. If we put ```7 > 14``` this is False.  

## Logical operators
These types of operators are used between two conditions and check whether True or False  
```&&``` Logical AND  
```||``` Logical OR  
```!``` Logical NOT  

EXAMPLE: ```5 > 2 && 6 < 10```  
There are two conditions and in the middle it there is an AND used. Now the answer will be True. To understand this   
you need to understand the Truth-False table from Discrete Mathematics.  

for AND logical operators:  
| Expression | Result |
|------------|--------|
| T && T     | T      |
| T && F     | F      |
| F && T     | F      |
| F && F     | F      |  

for OR logical operators:  
| Expression | Result |
|------------|--------|
| T || T     | T      |
| T || F     | T      |
| F || T     | T      |
| F || F     | F      |  

for NOT logical operators:
| Expression | Result |
|------------|--------|
| !T         | F      |
| !F         | T      |  

Logical NOT ```(!)``` work differently, it takes place before one condition and makes it flip like ```! (5 > 2)``` the answer is False  

## Conditional statement - if else
Think like this, if you have 100BDT then you will eat a burger. Now if you don't have 100BDT then you will not be able to eat the burger.  
We can write this like this:  
```
if i have 100BDT  
      i can eat burger  
or else  
      i will not  
```
To write conditions we have to maintain this format:  
```c
if (condition) {
      // codes
}
else {
      // codes
}
```
Example code: 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int BDT;
    scanf("%d", &BDT);
    
    if(BDT >= 100) {
        printf("I will eat");
    } else {
        printf("I will not eat");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
We can input the money, if we input 100 or more than 100 we can eat the burger, if we input lower than 100 we can't eat the burger.  
For example, we are choosing 120 BDT as an input.  
Input: 120  

Output:  
```C
I will eat
```
