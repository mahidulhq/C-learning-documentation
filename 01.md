## Introduction
Programming is how we tell computers what to do by writing instructions in a language they understand. Itâ€™s like giving the computer a recipe to follow so it can perform tasks, solve problems, or create software. This involves writing code, testing it, and fixing any mistakes.

## Why C?
Mother of all languages, C is more like a manual language.


## Basic structure of C programming  
Head --> Header files  
Body --> Main codes

## Header file
contains declarations for functions, macros, constants, and data types that can be shared between multiple source files. Header files help organize code and promote code reuse.


## First c program 
```c
// Basic Structures

#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
printf("Hello World");
return 0;
}
```

Output: 
```c
Hello World
```

A header file like ```#include<stdio.h>``` in programming is like a neuron in our brain. Just as neurons transmit signals and instructions to tell the body how to react, header files provide essential declarations and commands that guide the program on how to function.

## ore details
```c
// Basic Structures
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {

printf("Hello World");

return 0;
}
```
where, int is the return type of the **main** function, then calling the function using **()**
The full code must be inside of the **{}**, to end the function **return 0** is used. To the end of every line we must use a semicolon **;** to terminate statements.

## bit/ byte
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
int num1 = 10;
return 0;
}
```
The 
variable took size in memory, like  
int --> 4 byte  
float --> 4  byte  
char --> 1 byte  

on computer,   
            8 bit = 1 byte  
            
            1021 byte = 1 kb  
            1 kb = 1 mb  
            1024 mb = 1 gb  
            1021 gb = 1 tb  
            ...  
computers don't understand anything other than 0 and 1 (binary), so  
0 = 1 bit  
1 = 1 bit  
0 = 1 bit  
1 = 1 bit  

## Data types
specifier for data types,  
int --> %d  
float --> %f  
char --> %c  

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    float f = 4.56;
    char c = '8';

    printf("%d\n", num1);
    printf("%f\n", f);
    printf("%c", c);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```c
10
4.560000
8
```

But on float data type, we want to print 4.56, but the output gave 4.560000, where are four extra zeros. To print specifically
what we gave, we need to use %.2f specifier for float data type to print two numbers after a dot. 
```c
printf("%.2f\n", f);
```
output:
```
4.56
```
## Boolean data type
boolean data type: data type for it is **bool**  
bool only print true or false  
where true means 1  
      false means 0  
To use the bool data type specific header file needed; the header file for it **#include<stdbool.h>**  
bool datatype doesn't have any specific specifier, so as an integer %d is used to print bool.
sample:  
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
int main() {
    bool b = true;
    printf("%d\n", b);
    return 0;
}
```
output:
```
1
```
or
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
int main() {
    bool b = false;
    printf("%d\n", b);
    return 0;
}
```
output:
```
0
```
## take input on C
To take input on C, there is a function **scanf()**  
Whatever we gave it as an input, it took it in and by using **printf()** it prints.

& this symbol is called ampersand. It is used to represent the word "and."

example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a;
    scanf("%d", &a);
    
    printf("%d", a);
    return 0;
}
```
on output you can enter any integer number, because we take the input as int datatype ``` int a; ```  

now we can take input any datatypes  
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a;
    float f;
    char c;

    scanf("%d %f %c", &a, &f, &c);

    printf("%d %f %c", a, f, c);
}
```
output: 
```c
10 23.445000 v
```


## Data Type Limitations 
int --> 4 bytes  
long long int --> 8 bytes  

float --> 4 bytes  
double --> 8 bytes
